## Usage

### GoogleTranslator Component

The `GoogleTranslator` component dynamically loads the Google Translate script and initializes the translation element.

#### Example

To use the `GoogleTranslator` component, you can include it in your component as shown in the `LanguageSwitcher` example.

### LanguageSwitcher Component

The `LanguageSwitcher` component is a simple button that toggles the display of the `GoogleTranslator` component. When the button is clicked, the Google Translate element is displayed, allowing users to select their preferred language.

## Styling

The `GoogleTranslator` component includes custom styles to ensure the translation element blends seamlessly with your application’s design. These styles are dynamically injected when the component is rendered.

## Comparison with Established Libraries

### Pros of Custom Implementation

-   **Advanced Features**: Comprehensive i18n features such as context-based translations and pluralization.
-   **Type Safety**: Better development experience with TypeScript support.
-   **Simplicity**: Abstracts complexity, making implementation and maintenance easier.

#### Cons

-   **Dependencies**: Additional dependencies can increase bundle size.
-   **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding the library's API and concepts.
-   **Flexibility**: Limited by the library’s design and features.
